Tamim Iqbal
Bangladesh

Batsman

Tamim Iqbal was already one of Bangladesh's most assured batsmen at the time of his 21st birthday, and will be
 a vital component at the top of the order for years to come. His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh 
cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through.
