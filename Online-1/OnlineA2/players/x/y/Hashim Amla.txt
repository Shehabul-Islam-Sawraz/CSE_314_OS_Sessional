Hashim Amla
South Africa

Batsman

The classiest, calmest man on a cricket field, Hashim Amla's name is etched in South African cricket history. 
With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket,
 while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman 
to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.
