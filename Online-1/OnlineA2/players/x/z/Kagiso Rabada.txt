South Africa

Bowler

A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting 
talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had 
already established himself as a potential leader of the attack.
