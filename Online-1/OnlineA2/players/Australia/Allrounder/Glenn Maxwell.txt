Glenn Maxwell
Australia

Allrounder

One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell looked set to be a long-term a key man in Australia's middle
 order in the shorter formats. It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate 
as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. However, in 2017-18 his career entered a confusing stage as he was dropped from the ODI side and then told by new coach Justin Langer to "go and make hundreds" without seemingly being given the opportunities to do so.
