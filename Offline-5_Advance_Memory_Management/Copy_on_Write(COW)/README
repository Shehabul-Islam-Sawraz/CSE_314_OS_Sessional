### The problem

The fork() system call in xv6 copies all of the parent process's user-space memory into the child. If the parent is large, copying can take a long time. Worse, the work is often largely wasted; for example, a fork() followed by exec() in the child will cause the child to discard the copied memory, probably without ever using most of it. On the other hand, if both parent and child use a page, and one or both writes it, a copy is truly needed.
